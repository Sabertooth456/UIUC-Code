        Variables Impacting Climate Change
      </h1>
      <div>
        <h4>1. Electricity and heat generation</h4>
        <p>
          This sector creates approximately 28% of all greenhouse gas emissions, occuring mainly in thermal power plants that produce electricity by burning coal and/or its derivatives.
          While civilians are often implied to be the primary users of electricity, the Transportation, Industry, and Agriculture sectors are also significant users.
        </p>
        <h4>2. Transportation</h4>
        <p>
          Transportation also accounts for approximately 28% of greenhouse gas emissions, due to motor vehicles' heavy reliance on fossil fuels.
          Several countries and global institutions have tried to limit emissions from motor vehicles, with the European Union setting the strictest regulations.
          In this regard, efficient transportation like trains and buses as well as eletric vehicles all contribute less to climate change than fossil fuel vehicles.
        </p>
        <h4>3. Industry</h4>
        <p>
          Coming in at 22% of all greenhouse case emissions is the US's industrial sector.
          Things like manufacturing, refining, food production, etc. all emit greenhouse gases when they utilize fossil fuels for heat, power, or chemical processes.
          Nor does this number include indirect emissions from industrial processes.
          If electricity were included, Industry would rise to 29%, the second largest contributor to climate change.
        </p>
        <h4>4. Commercial and residential emissions</h4>
        <p>
          In fourth place is the commercial and residential sector, covering approximately 11% of the US's greenhouse gas emissions.
          However, if indirect emissions such as cooking, heating, air-conditioning and poor waste treatment are included, the number jumps to 32% of all the US's greenhouse gas emissions.
        </p>
        <h4>5. Agriculture</h4>
        <p>
          Finally, agriculture accounts for 9% of the US's greenhouse emissions.
          This occurs when farmers use various soil and crop management techniques to increase the nitrogen in the soil which as a byproduct, increases nitrogen emissions to the air.
          Livestock and cattle are also contributors, releasing methane as part of their digestive process.
