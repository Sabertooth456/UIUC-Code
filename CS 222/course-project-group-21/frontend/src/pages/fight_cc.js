          So what can you do?

        <h4>1. Pressure, pressure, pressure</h4>

          The most important part of public change is public participation.
          Join organizations like Count Us In, which aims to inspire 1 billion people to challenge their leaders to act more boldly on climate.
          Another option is to join the UN's #ActNow campaign on climate change and sustainability.

        <h4>2. Change your transpotation</h4>
        <p>
          Electric Cars are becoming increasingly common, but a cheaper alternative is to simply walk or buy a bike.
          Carpool is another option to lower the overall amount of cars on the road.
        </p>
        <h4>3. Lower spending</h4>
        <p>
          An even simpler choice would be lowering consumption of things like electricity, heating, clothing, and diet.
          Installing solar panels, switching to LED lights, and improving your home's insulation are all valid ways to decrease your impact on the environment.
          As for the consumption side of things, eco-friendly products, foods, and eco-friendly investments.
